In React Native, a seemingly innocuous error can stem from incorrectly using the `useEffect` hook with asynchronous operations.  For example, consider fetching data from an API:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const json = await response.json();
    setData(json);
  };
  fetchData();
}, []);
```

The problem arises when the component unmounts before `fetchData` completes.  This can lead to `setData` being called after the component is gone, resulting in a warning or unexpected behavior.  The solution involves cleaning up the asynchronous operation.
